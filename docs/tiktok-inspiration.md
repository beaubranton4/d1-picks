# TikTok Slideshow System - Reference & Strategy

## The Winning Formula

The most effective TikTok slideshow hooks follow this pattern:

> **[Another person] + [conflict or doubt] → showed them [the thing] → they changed their mind**

This creates instant relatability. Someone doubted you. You proved them wrong. Viewers want to see the payoff.

## Hook Architecture

### Slide 1: The Setup
- Introduce a skeptic (roommate, girlfriend, dad, coworker)
- State their doubt or criticism
- Creates immediate tension

### Slide 2-3: The Reveal
- "Little does he know..."
- Start showing the evidence
- Build anticipation

### Slide 4-5: The Proof
- Data points, screenshots, results
- Show the actual site/product
- Make it undeniable

### Slide 6: The CTA
- Where to find it
- Why it's different
- Clear next step

## Image Generation Rules

### Always Use Portrait Orientation
- TikTok is vertical: 1024x1536 pixels
- Never horizontal - it won't fill the screen

### The "iPhone Photo" Prompt Trick
Always include these elements in image prompts:
- "iPhone photo" - triggers realistic camera aesthetic
- "realistic lighting" - avoids that AI glow
- Life details: coffee cups, beer bottles, laptops, remotes
- Slight imperfections: grain, natural skin tones
- Candid energy: not posed, mid-reaction

### Text Overlay Rules
- Font size: 6.5% of image height (99.84px for 1536px height)
- Position: Below TikTok status bar safe zone (~100px from top)
- Max line width to prevent text squishing
- White text with black outline for readability on any background
- Keep text short - must be readable in 0.5 seconds

### Consistency Matters
- Keep the same person/setting across non-screenshot slides
- This creates the "story" feeling
- Only break consistency for screenshot/proof slides

## Scene Types That Work

### The Apartment Couch
Young person sitting on worn leather couch, phone in hand. Living room vibes. TV in background. Beer and laptop on coffee table. The "I just found something amazing" moment.

### The Sports Bar
Two friends in a booth. One showing phone to skeptical friend. TVs showing sports in background. The "let me show you this" moment.

### The Kitchen Counter
Morning scene. Showing phone to partner over coffee. Natural light from window. The "I told you so" moment.

### The Bankroll Shot
Close-up of phone screen showing profit. Hand holding phone. Desk/keyboard visible in background. The proof moment.

## Caption Best Practices

### Always Include:
- The hook (first line = most important)
- 3-5 relevant hashtags
- CTA with website

### Example Caption:
```
My roommate said betting college baseball was dumb.

Then I showed him my bankroll.

## Posting Strategy

### Best Times to Post
- Morning: 7-9am (commute scrolling)
- Lunch: 12-2pm (break time)
- Evening: 7-10pm (prime time)

### Frequency
- 2-3 TikToks per day is optimal
- Consistency > volume
- Vary hook templates to test what works

### Music Selection
- Use trending sounds (check TikTok Creative Center)
- Upbeat/inspirational works for "success" hooks
- Dramatic for "hater" hooks
- Educational/chill for explainer hooks

## Performance Tracking

### Metrics That Matter
- **Views**: Raw reach
- **Watch time**: Did they finish all slides?
- **Comments**: Engagement quality
- **Shares**: Viral potential
- **Profile visits**: Intent to learn more
- **Link clicks**: Conversion

### A/B Testing
- Test different hook styles (Doubter vs Education vs Anti-Tout)
- Test different image styles (apartment vs sports bar)
- Test different posting times
- Log everything - let data drive decisions

## The D1 Picks Angle

### Why College Baseball Works for Content

1. **Mispriced Markets**: Books don't price college baseball as sharply as MLB
2. **Data Edge**: Warren Nolan predictions are free and accurate
3. **Underdog Wins**: More upsets than major sports = better stories
4. **Niche = Less Competition**: Not everyone is making college baseball content

### Key Messages to Hammer

- Free forever (anti-tout angle)
- Math not hype (show the edge calculation)
- Transparent methodology (we show you how)
- Soft lines = more edges (why college baseball specifically)

## Content Calendar Template

### Monday
- "Week preview" hook
- "Here's what I'm watching this week"

### Tuesday-Thursday
- "Doubter" hooks
- "Secret edge" content
- Education plays

### Friday
- Weekend preview
- "Big games to bet" angle

### Saturday-Sunday
- Live results
- "When the pick hits" reaction content

### Post-Weekend
- Results recap
- "Another profitable week" proof

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overpromising**: Never say "lock" or "guaranteed"
2. **Boring slide 1**: If hook isn't compelling, they swipe
3. **Too much text**: Can't read it fast enough
4. **Horizontal images**: Doesn't fill screen, looks amateur
5. **No CTA**: Always tell them where to go
6. **Inconsistent posting**: Algorithm punishes gaps
7. **Ignoring comments**: Engagement drives reach
