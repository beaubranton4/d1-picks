# TikTok Photo Slideshow Scripts - Testing Guide

Ready-to-use scripts for D1 Picks TikTok. All optimized for PHOTO SLIDESHOWS (not video).

---

## What Makes Photo Slideshows Go Viral

### The Psychology

1. **Curiosity Gap**: Slide 1 creates a question. Viewers swipe to find the answer.
2. **Story Arc**: Setup → Conflict → Resolution in 4-6 slides
3. **Pattern Interrupt**: Something unexpected disrupts their scrolling
4. **Relatability**: "That's literally me" feeling
5. **Social Proof**: "This worked for someone else, maybe for me too"

### The TikTok Algorithm & Slideshows

- **Watch time is king**: More swipes = more engagement = more reach
- **Completion rate matters**: Make slides irresistible to finish
- **Comment bait works**: End with something people HAVE to respond to
- **Save-worthy content**: Educational = saves = algorithmic boost

### The Winning Formula

```
[SKEPTIC/DOUBT] → [REVEAL/PROOF] → [TRANSFORMATION] → [CTA]
```

**Slide 1**: Hook with conflict (someone doubts you)
**Slide 2-3**: Build tension ("little does he know...")
**Slide 4**: The proof/revelation
**Slide 5**: The result/transformation
**Slide 6**: Where to get it (CTA)
